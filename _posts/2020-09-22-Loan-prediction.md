**Data:**The dataset contained in this project has 4,303 records with 24 data series.

Modeled a classifier for Loan Default Prediction based on the borrower’s financial history to minimize bank’s lending risk. Achieved an accuracy of 84% using Ada-boost classifier. Tools used included: Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**Cosine Similarity:**

It is a method to measure the difference between two non zero vectors of an inner product space. See the example below to understand.

**Data cleaning**:The data set is pretty neat. I only removed the ones that had the lowest count of user ratings.

**Modelling:** I built this recommender calculating cosine similarity between movies. The similarity was calculated using two vectors that contained movie ratings.

**Testing system:**

To test the system I provided it a movie ‘Guardian of Galaxy’ – and knew to certain extent what the recommendations would be. The first 3 movies in the recommendation list had a match with the genre.
